 Key Ideas:
On each day, you can solve problems in strictly increasing difficulty order.

Consecutive problems on the same day must have a vi rating difference of at least K.

You want to minimize the number of days — this means maximizing how many problems you can solve in one day (i.e., finding longest possible valid subsequences), and repeating this.

The approach:

Repeatedly find the longest valid subsequence (difficulty increasing + vi difference ≥ K).

Remove those problems from the list.

Repeat the above steps until all problems are solved.
